# Combine temporal aggregation with older-first strategy
# Refuse newly coming chunks until the last chunk ends x%

name: temporal_older
manager_name: TemporalOlderManager

# coef: exponential averaging coefficient (0.0 to 1.0)
# action = (1 - coef) * new_action + coef * old_action
# Default: 0.1
coef: 0.1

# older_coef: threshold coefficient for accepting new chunks (0.0 to 1.0)
# New chunks are only accepted if current_step >= len(chunk) * older_coef
# Default: 0.75
older_coef: 0.75
