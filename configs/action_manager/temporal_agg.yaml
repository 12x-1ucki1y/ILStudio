# Temporal Aggregation Action Manager Configuration
# Exponentially average the last and the new chunks for better smoothness

name: temporal_agg
manager_name: TemporalAggManager

# coef: exponential averaging coefficient (0.0 to 1.0)
# action = (1 - coef) * new_action + coef * old_action
# Higher values give more weight to old actions (smoother but less responsive)
# Lower values give more weight to new actions (more responsive but less smooth)
# Default: 0.1
coef: 0.1
